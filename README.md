# Hi everyone!! My name is Rohit Yadav

## Data Analytics · Data Science · Applied Machine Learning

I am a data professional with experience across data analytics, data science, and applied machine learning, focused on building analytical systems that translate data into measurable business and operational outcomes.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Management at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where my academic work emphasizes statistical analysis, data modeling, business intelligence, data warehousing, and data visualization. Alongside coursework, I actively build end-to-end projects that mirror real-world data problems rather than academic exercises.

Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at Siemens, where I developed and operationalized machine learning models on large-scale industrial and IoT data. My work included time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, data pipeline orchestration, and KPI monitoring. These solutions were used in production environments and contributed to reduced unplanned downtime, improved data reliability, and faster issue resolution. I regularly collaborated with engineering and business stakeholders to ensure analytical outputs translated into actionable decisions.

More recently, I worked as a Pricing and Data Analyst Intern at International Motors, analyzing 10M+ records using Hadoop SQL to support pricing strategy and decision-making. I built analytical models and dashboards consumed by Sales and Finance teams, validated model outputs against historical benchmarks, standardized pricing datasets, and contributed to improvements in pricing efficiency, forecast reliability, and contract margins. This role strengthened my interest in analytics that sit at the intersection of data, business strategy, and systems.

## What You’ll Find in This GitHub

This GitHub serves as a portfolio of applied data projects that reflect how I approach real data problems:

- Causal inference and experimentation  
  Projects involving A/B testing, causal impact analysis, and uplift modeling to estimate true treatment effects and optimize decision-making.

- Relational database design and SQL analytics  
  End-to-end database modeling, schema design, and analytical querying with a strong emphasis on data integrity and performance.

- Analytics automation and data platforms  
  Projects that integrate data pipelines, APIs, and BI tools to move insights closer to stakeholders and reduce manual workflows.

Each repository includes clear documentation, reproducible analysis, and an emphasis on realistic assumptions and measurable outcomes.

## Technical Focus

I am most comfortable working with:
- Python and SQL for analysis, modeling, and data processing  
- Relational databases and data warehouses for structured analytics  
- Big data and ETL systems for scalable data handling  
- Business intelligence and visualization tools for decision support  

I value clarity, robustness, and explainability over unnecessary complexity, and I prioritize solutions that can be deployed, maintained, and understood by others.

## Areas of Interest

I am particularly interested in roles related to:
- Data Analytics  
- Data Science  
- Data Engineering  

Especially in environments where data is used not only to report outcomes, but to influence decisions, improve systems, and drive measurable impact at scale.

## Notes for Reviewers

- Each project repository contains a detailed README explaining the problem, approach, tools, and results.  
- Metrics reported are realistic, defensible, and based on analytical evaluation rather than hypothetical claims.  
- The code emphasizes structure, readability, and reproducibility.
